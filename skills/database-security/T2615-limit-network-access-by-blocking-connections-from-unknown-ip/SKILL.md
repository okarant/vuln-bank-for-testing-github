# T2615: Limit network access by blocking connections from unknown IP addresses (PostgreSQL)

**Category:** INFRA  
**SD Elements:** [T2615](https://cd.sdelements.com/bunits/oleg-skill-test/vuln-bank-for-testing-github-app-20260616-1404/vuln-bank-for-testing-github-20260616-1404/tasks/31909-T2615/)  
**Priority:** 8  
**Domain:** database-security

## Affected Areas in This Repository

database.py (connection pool authenticates as the Postgres superuser `postgres`), docker-compose.yml (postgres:13 service, POSTGRES_USER=postgres)

## Why Not Directly Code-Fixable in This Repository

Create a dedicated least-privilege application DB role, parameterize queries, bound result-set sizes, validate the connection string, and restrict the application's DB grants to only the tables/operations it needs.

**Recommended Action:** Track and implement this control at the infrastructure/operations or governance level; document the responsible owner.

## Implementation Guidance (SD Elements)

Verify that the __pg_hba.conf__ configuration file uses rules to restrict access based on username, database, and source IP. 

A simple policy might:
- Permit a local user to have wide-ranging access
- Require a secure authentication method
- Allow a specific range of IP addresses to connect remotely to a specific database
 
Here's an example:

	# TYPE    DATABASE   USER            ADDRESS          METHOD
	host      all        postgres-admin  127.001/32     scram-sha-256
	hostssl   store-db   store-app       192.168.12.0/24  scram-sha-256
	host      all        all             all              reject

PostgreSQL uses the first matching rule. Here, the `postgres-admin` user can only log in from the local host (`127.001`), while the `store-app` user can log in from any IP beginning with `192.168.12` when accessing the `store-db` database.

Use a database value of `samerole` to allow users to access just the database that has the same name as the user account:

	hostssl   samerole    all            192.168.12.0/24  scram-sha-256

## Note
Network restrictions with the __pg.hba.conf__ file should be set in __addition__ to the usual network protection measures, such as subnetting and firewalls. For example, a good firewall rule would reject TCP traffic going to the database server on port 5432 unless it originates from the application server's IP.

## Success Criteria

- The requirement "Limit network access by blocking connections from unknown IP addresses (PostgreSQL)" is documented with an owner and an infrastructure/process plan.
